# Python-JSON-Requests
# Created by Dylan Werelius on August 2, 2022

This program was created to help me learn python as a language and also to help me learn how to make JSON request as well as general requests from a web server.

The web server used in the example is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ which provides some sample data that can be pulled using python code. The required files that will need to be downloaded for this program are "json" (which actually doesn't need to be downloaded because it is apparently built into python) and "requests". The program will prompt the user to type in the username of the person whose information they want to pull and then the code will print out the full name, email address, and phone number of the person associated with the username.

The YouTube video that I learned this from is linked below:
